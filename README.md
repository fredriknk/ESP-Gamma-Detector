# ESP Gamma Detector
 
![HEADER](./PICTURES/_PICTURE_.PNG)

Open hardware for a hackable scintillation counter and multichannel analyzer (MCA) all-in-one device using a popular NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The design is forked and derived from [OpenGammaProject](https://github.com/OpenGammaProject)'s [Open-Gamma-Detector](https://github.com/OpenGammaProject/Open-Gamma-Detector). Thanks a lot to u/[Phoenix1747](https://github.com/Phoenix1747) for making a well documented and awesome open source design! 

The schematics has been ported from easy-EDA to Kicad 7, it has allso been designed to work with an ESP-32 instead of RPI-Pico. The esp32 will be nice for having wifi capability, but will need a dedicated ADC due to the ADC on esp32-wroom being a steaming pile of shit
